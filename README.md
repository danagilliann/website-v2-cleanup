# MY WEBSITE!
[The site!](http://danagilliann.me/)

### Cool things to know:
- Built this from scratch
- The content of the "Projects" is populated through a Tumblr API JSONP request (fun fact: JSONP is GET only).
- I made it using HTML, CSS (Sass and Animate.css), and Javascript (jQuery, Angular, and Gulp)
